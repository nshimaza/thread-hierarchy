# thread-hierarchy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nshimaza/thread-hierarchy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nshimaza/thread-hierarchy)

Managing Haskell threads in hierarchical manner.

Threads created by newChild guarantee automatic cleanup on its exit regardless normal exit
or cancellation by asynchronous exception.

In order to this module works properly, user must ensure following rules.

* User provided thread handler must accept `ThreadMap` as its first argument.
* When new thread created by newChild, handler receives newly created empty `ThreadMap`.
* When the user provided handler creates its child thread, it must use newChild.
* At the same time, the handler must pass the `ThreadMap` received via its argument to newChild.

`ThreadMap` is mutable map holding live threads.  Each threads managed by this module has its
own `ThreadMap` instance.  Each `ThreadMap` keeps live "child" threads for future cleanup on exit.
Populating `ThreadMap` is done by newChild automatically.
Actually the function newChild accept a `ThreadMap` then mutate it.

At the same time newChild create a new empty `ThreadMap` for newly created thread and pass it
to user provided handler of the new thread.
Also newChild automatically install cleanup routine which kill all threads living in the new
`ThreadMap` created for the thread.
The cleanup routine also unregister itself from `ThreadMap` of parent.

In order to work this properly, user provided thread handler must use newChild with `ThreadMap`
given via its argument when it creates its child so that cleanup routine can terminate
its children properly.


### Example

When you create the first thread managed by this module, create a new empty `ThreadMap` then call
newChild with it.  The newCall automatically install cleanup routine to the handler you provided.

```haskell
createRootThread :: IO ThreadId
createRootThread = do
    rootThreadMap <- newThreadMap
    threadID <- newChild rootThreadMap rootThreadHandler
    return threadID
```

When a thread managed by this module creates its child thread, call newChild with `TreadMap`
received via handlers argument.

```haskell
rootThreadHandler :: ThreadMap -> IO ()
rootThreadHandler myChildrenThreadMap = do
    void $ newChild myChildrenThreadMap $ \grandChildrenThreadMap -> do
        yourCode
        return ()
```

You can install your own cleanup routine using finally or both resource acquisition and cleanup
routine using bracket.

```haskell
    -- Forking a new child with your own cleanup
    void $ newChild childrenOfCurrentThread $ \childrenOfHandler ->
        yourThreadHandler `finally` yourCleanupRoutine

    -- Forking a new child with resource acquisition and cleanup
    void $ newChild childrenOfCurrentThread $ \childrenOfHandler ->
        bracket yourResourceAcquiringRoutine yourCleanupRoutine yourThreadHandler
```

### Limitation

Currently, unlike async function, this module is not designed to back any return value
from child thread to parent thread.  This module focuses on guaranteed cleanup on thread termination.
